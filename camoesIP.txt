I'm a master's student working on my thesis on Natural Language Processing. A part of my research is to automatically predict the CEFR level of a text with a language model, and in my literature review I found a paper (Santos et al. “Neural Text Categorization with Transformers for Learning Portuguese as a Second Language.”) that used corpora provided by Camões IP. I was wondering if I could have access to this CEFR annotated corpora for my thesis, since it would be of extreme help. Thank you
