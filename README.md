# Master's Thesis - Learning what to learn: Generating Language Lessons using BERT
This repository has work done regarding my master's thesis. 

## Task 1 - Proficiency classification
Work regarding the first task, namely fine-tuning a BERTimbau model for classifying Portuguese text difficulty in the CEFR scale, can be found [here](./Task%201%20-%20Proficiency%20classification/).

## Task 1.5 - Classifying Tatoeba sentences by difficulty
In between the two tasks, an intermediate difficulty classification of Tatoeba sentences was done. It can be found [here](./Task%201.5%20-%20Classify%20Tatoeba%20sentences%20by%20difficulty/).

## Task 2 - Topic modeling
Finally, topic modeling was done, which can be found [here](./Task%202%20-%20Topic%20Modeling%20(VSC)/).
